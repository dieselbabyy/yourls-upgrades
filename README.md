A group of scripts/hacks/plugins to improve use of the YOURLs link shortening software for various uses.

## Preview metadata & images plugin

The readme for this specific file can be seen at [https://github.com/dieselbabyy/yourls-upgrades/preview-metadata-plugin.md](https://github.com/dieselbabyy/yourls-upgrades/blob/main/preview-metadata-plugin.md) and contains optional instructions to extend the functionality as well as installation instructions.

The `/metadata-plugin/` folder simply contains `plugin.php` which has the "grab n' go" version, ready to use.

***Note that this is all still a heavy work in progress type deal, and I'll get around to modifying and making this readme worthwhile when I can.***
